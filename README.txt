Description: 

the Purpose of the game
The player must bring the king to the throne (a certain point on the board). The thing is, like the game
Chess, the king is quite limited in his abilities, and he can only move on empty squares on the board. To this end the king
Accompanied by an entourage that will clear the way for him and help him reach the goal.


the king. As mentioned, the object of the game is to bring the king to the throne. The king can go on
Empty tiles, on tiles that have a key (but do not pick it up), enter the teleport booth
Move with its help) This is a special tile, which can be moved with its help to another place, as will be explained below (
Or of course settle on the throne. The King is represented in the game board by the letter K (for King.)
● The Wizard. The wizard's special ability is to put out a fire. The sorcerer can walk on tiles
Empty, on fire tiles) so he turns it off, and the tile becomes an empty tile (, tiles that have
Key) but do not take it (, and it can stand on a teleport cell) but do not pass with its help!
The Wizard is represented in the game board by the letter M (for Mage.)
● The warrior. The warrior's special ability is to fight the orcs. He always wins :(. The warrior can
Go for empty tiles and ones that have orcs) so the player actually makes him fight
In them, and as stated, win (also he can enter a teleport cell) and pass with his help (and he can
Stand on tiles that have a key (but do not pick it up). When the warrior kills the orc, he falls
From it a key) that is, the tile turns from one that has an orc on it to one that has a key (. The warrior

And open a gate with its help. One key to one gate, without any uniqueness) i.e. each key is developed
Each gate (. The next gate will need an additional key. The thief can carry only one key at most.
If he already carries one key, he can not take another key. The thief can walk on tiles
Empty, on tiles that have a key, enter a teleport cell) and pass with its help (and enter

Notes: 
We write the game by using an Matrix 
And when you get in to the level the Code Will head how many 
Rows and col its have then read the Area and what its have
And the Character find them using index that we are give it to them 
That say if K 2 3 
thats say the King is in Row = 2 & col = 3
And the Code Will calculate were is it and if the King move one step
The Code Will add to the index 1 and his Location Will be updated like that
And all Character like that we defined them
